# 📌 Working with Subqueries in SQL

## 📊 Project Overview

This project is focused on **mastering subqueries in SQL** through hands-on practice using two different databases: one for **employees** and one for **customers**. The repository includes a series of structured SQL exercises, each with corresponding queries and answers.

This project was part of a guided course on Coursera, and upon completion, I earned a certificate to validate my learning.
